# Preset devices. Built from device MAC address, and measurement paths to be subscribed to.
# E.g. Meas/Acc/13 for accelerometer measurements at 13Hz. Refer to MoveSense API for more details
# It appears that the API ignores the higher sampling rates. This could be firmware issue, or perhaps require some other
# pathing? Documentation for API and important parts: https://bitbucket.org/movesense/movesense-device-lib/src/master/
# Hypothesis: The sampling rate is not read from the path and the API requires a separate call for adjusting.
# Alternative: BLE or individual devices struggle with the data-rate or rate of packages (unlikely)
